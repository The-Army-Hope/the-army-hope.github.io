# ALL RESOURCES USED IN THE PROJECT
Below is the complete list of parts, components and tools we used so that anyone can replicate what we did.<br>
This is NOT a tutorial, it's only a LIST. If you'd like instructions and all of the repositories where our projects and this one too are stored, go to [Coding](./coding.md).

## Electrical parts
Besides a decent 3d printer, hot glue, a general Nylon Glove, general strings and some other generic tools, you'll also need:
| ID | Part name (you can also find these parts easily in other non italian stores)                                            | Part number | Quantity                                                             |

## Digital Sources and Tools
We used [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to edit and [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/it/software/ultimaker-cura/) for slicing all the 3D models used.<br>
Sometimes we used [Arduino Ide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) but later on switched entirely to [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/) for coding (so we could also use and test wireless data transfers).<br>
You can find all of the used 3D models used [here](https://github.com/The-Army-Hope/RemoteArm/tree/main/assets).<br>
We had the idea of using potentiometers instead of flex sensors for all the fingers from [Lucas VRTech's video](https://youtu.be/nmP8iGaPbeI?si=rUJtxDgF3J3tuFM_).
